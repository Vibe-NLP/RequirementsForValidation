# RequirementsForValidation
This forler contains the NLP tool QuARS and the requirements documents used for the validation of the VIBE approach


We observe that in People by Temperament some requirements are labeled with "MAY" to indicate that their implementation is optional, in other words, this document specifically envisages a family of products. We address neutral requirement documents (as defined in Section 3), and we do not count these labels among the terms found by QuARS: what we have shown with the analysis is that in addition to explicit variabilities it also contains implicit ones.
